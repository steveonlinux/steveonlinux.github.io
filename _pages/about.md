Hello! I'm a Computer Science and Math major with a deep passion for Linux, holding expertise as a Linux specialist. My enthusiasm extends beyond just using the systemâ€”I am a committed open source enthusiast, actively contributing to and learning from the community.

I am currently seeking a position that allows me to leverage my skills in Linux, particularly in roles related to system administration and DevOps. My professional journey includes significant experience in IT at Managed Service Providers, where I've honed my technical and problem-solving skills. I'm also proud to hold certifications from CompTIA and RedHat, which underscore my commitment and expertise in the field.

When I'm not immersed in the digital world, I love stepping into nature. Camping and hiking are my go-to activities for recharging and reconnecting with the outdoors.

I am excited about the opportunities to bring my technical acumen and passion for Linux to a dynamic team, where I can contribute to meaningful projects and continue to grow in my career.
